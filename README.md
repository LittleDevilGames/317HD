# 317HD
A 317 client with the rendering engine ported to libgdx

# What's with these naming conventions, are you stupid?
It's not my fault. The most complete refactor of a 317 client was poorly done. I'm not wasting my time refactoring one from scratch.

# Goal
The goal of the client is to have a 317 client, where the engine has been replaced with libgdx. On top of this, I am to make general
improvements to the client overall, such as better usage of OO.

# Contributing
* Refactor any namings you come across that use invalid naming conventions (optional)
* If you refactor anything, please keep the refactoring in their own commits, so I can distinguish between refactoring and actual changes
* Do not attempt to do anything crazy such as refactoring the whole project with a 3rd party tool
